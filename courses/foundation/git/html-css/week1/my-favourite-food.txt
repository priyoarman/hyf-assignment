Burger Recipe:

Mix the mince, diced onion and parsley in a big bowl. Then, go for it – hands are the only way to get the onion properly combined through the meat.
Add the sauces and the egg yolk, and give it another good mix. I then roll 8 balls from a mixture of the same size. Each ball I dump on the cling wrap and press down into a patty shape, then wrap it up. These guys are great to have in the freezer, so I make the whole 8 and freeze.
Find a nice, heavy pan or griddle pan and heat it to very hot – where you hover your hand over the surface and can feel strongly what a bad idea it is to get any closer.
Slap 2 patties taken straight from the fridge down on your griddle pan and admire the sizzling. Your oyster sauce will do its flavouring job, so there is no need to further season. I like my burger boys pink in the middle: after 2 minutes, I turn each patty 90 degrees, still on the same side, to give it a lovely griddle lattice pattern, which is a bit daft given it will be hidden in a bun and all, but I’ll know its there.
Assemble the burger in a bun and add a choice of greens and burger dressing.
